This is  a summary of the course from my ow undertanding so I can come back to it and get useful information

Part #1 - Prepare yourself to learn

Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: you have just rubbed a magic lamp, and a genie appears promising to teach you just one single thing at an incredibly high level.
What would you choose to learn?
Some would choose to learn data analysis or finance; others would choose drama, singing or football, while some would prefer entrepreneurship, biology or perhaps engineering.
If I were you, I would answer: "I want to learn how to learn!"
This answer would be like telling the genie "I wish to be able to make as many wishes as I want." 😏

Model that’s been developed by Carol Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford University.

Learning principles --> My Whatchward and Theme
These principles were developed by the Alternative University of Bucharest, which is dedicated to self-directed learning.

1. I craft myself consciously: Designing yourself by choosing what you want to learn

2. I can learn anything, anytime.

3. Learning happens outside the classroom.

4. Learning is connected to the environment.

5. Learning is meaningful.

6. Learning is fun!

7. Learning involves changing my brain.

8. I integrate failure.

9. I take responsibility for my own learning.

10. We are all learners.

	
Part #2 - Define your learning strategy
Use an analysis tool to prepare your learning plan
Get Document (Excel Sheet) (In the assets) 
https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5281811-learn-how-to-learn/5514591-define-your-strategic-goal

Step 1
Select or write in a strategic goal ---> What is the general direction in which you want to conduct your learning?
Fill in the field to which your strategic goal applies. --->  A collection of disciplines or subjects for study.
Filling in your Ikigai diagram. (In the image Assets)

Step 2
SWOT Analysis ---> Analyse your strengths and weaknesses

SWOT Analysis ---> Analyse your Oppurtunities and threats
Opportunities ----> May take different forms from one goal to another. If you are undertaking a career change, then job offers or courses in your future field are examples of opportunities. 
If you are in a job and decide to advance in your career, each new responsibility or promotion is an opportunity.
The first thing you need to analyse is how the opportunity in question matches up with your strategic goal.
Then, like a business person, you could think in terms of return on investment. 

Threats --->  the actual or potential obstacles to achieving your strategic goal

Step 3 
Match your subjects of study with opportunities and threats
Your offensive tactics are actions that will permit you to capitalise on your strengths in order to take advantage of opportunities
Your defensive tactics are actions that allow you to capitalise on your strengths, but this time in order to manage your threats to learning. 
Your preventative tactics are actions that correct your weaknesses in order to take advantage of opportunities
your emergency tactics are actions that will - again – help correct your weaknesses, but this time in order to eliminate potential threats to your learning.

Part #3 - Create your personalised learning plan

Step 1
Prioritise your subjects for study ----> Use the Spreadsheet to fill details (Register and LogBook)
Add traget levels ---> Formulate your micro-goals the SMART way
A target level that is sufficiently specific, measurable and time-based is easier to aim for.

Step 2
Break down your subjects for study into actions
What you need to do now is break down your subjects into actions that will close the gap between your current and target level of competence for each micro-goal.

To break down each subject into actions, you need to ask yourself:
What do I need to do in order to achieve my target?
Use learning methods PDF and SWOT analysis

Tips for designing your training sessions:

Training sessions are usually of three types:
Deliberate practice, for learning through self-guided exercises.
Guided sessions, for learning from others.
And complementary activities, for other forms of learning, like reading or reflecting.

Training sessions should have a do-and-improve cyclical structure:
you do something through a learning method;
you get feedback;
you reflect on the feedback;
and integrate it into your learning; 
and then you do it again.

Getting feedback is key to effective learning.

Training requires three things to be effective:
An objective
A fun design
A re-design through which you improve your learning process


Step 3
Identify possible resources

You can distinguish at least four principal types:
Physical tools
Knowledge materials
Human resources
Package trainings

Select knowledge support materials
here is an incredible variety of support materials. Some are extremely interactive, while others are less so. It is up to you to choose between the various:
Software programs
Applications
Video courses and tutorials
Paper, digital or audio books
Podcasts
Other resources

Surround yourself with good human resources
To start to recruit your human resources, I invite you to find at least:
One + : a person more experienced than you in the subject (a role model, mentor, coach, tutor or teacher).
One = : another learner at a level fairly similar to your own (a learning buddy). You can then share your progress and help each other. 
One – : another learner, at a lower level than your own, to whom you can give back what you have learnt.


Step 4 
Organise your timetable

Design your typical week:

To design a balanced and relevant typical learning week, I suggest that you follow the following steps:
Schedule your time for rest, social and family life or hobbies, in order to define your minimum quality-of-life threshold. 
Identify the various periods that generally make up your week. You can distinguish, e.g. work time, travel time and free time.
Next, try to allocate the right activities to the right time periods.
Ideally, deliberate practice (with a performance goal) should be central to your daily schedule. If you are already practising full-time in the field in which you want to progress, it will be enough for you to bring learning into the heart of that practice. Otherwise, you must be satisfied with second-choice time periods. 
If you haven't allocated deliberate practice, you could use your free time to do guided sessions. 
Reserve complementary activities (listening to a podcast etc.) for moments when you cannot be more active, e.g. while travelling or walking.

Archive your sessions in the LogBook
I advise you to take a moment, each week and each month, to review your progress. 
If you realise that you are not progressing as planned, you will need to review your schedule. 


Part #4 - Maximise your learningManage your learning enviroment

Step 1

To create optimal external conditions, systematically identify and reduce all the frictions holding back your learning, which make you lose time and willpower.
Control your physical environment

Control your digital environment

Step 2
Accelerate your progress through active learning
Active learning,  Learning by doing

Re-explaining what you have learnt orally and in writing:
to somebody,
to something,
or to yourself.

Step 3
Giving back to your community
When you persevere in the study of a subject, you join its learning community. 
In other words, you join a group of people who are excited about the same subject matter.

The social dynamics of these communities offer opportunities for informal learning. 
The more you become an active member, the more you will reinforce your learning.

"To teach is to learn twice." - Joseph Joubert

move from being a consumer of knowledge to being a consumer/creator: from a simple receiver, to a receiver/transmitter. 
In other words, you will be able to give back to the community what it gave you when you started out.

There is no lack of ways to contribute.  Very practically, to participate in and organise these communities, you will be able to:
Reply to questions in the forums;
Discuss orally, over the phone or by video link with other learners;
Create content (articles, videos, podcasts etc.);
Give training sessions;
Take part in conferences;
Participate in events (meetups, hackathons, etc.).
Become the mentor that you would have dreamt of having when you started out, whether as a volunteer, for your family and friends, or for remuneration.


Step 4 
Practise maximising your learning by creating a mind map
you are going to decide, among all the things you've learned by following this course, what will be the most valuable to you personally, and you'll organize it into a single visual. 
This will require some reflexion, some visits back to your notes or to a few of the course chapters, and some creativity!

Here's a suggestion:
Start by writing your name in the center.
Branch out by writing the 7 learning styles from part 1 around your name.
Create sub-branches for each learning style by brainstorming specific learning activities that you've engaged in successfully in the past or that you would like to try out.
You might even add sub-sub-branches by drafting SMART goals for the activities that you think have the most potential for your learning plan.
To refine your ideas for a new, final draft of the mind map, focus on just 3 of the learning styles and 3-5 activities for each one. Omit the others. This added focus will ensure that your mind map becomes actionable rather than overwhelming.

This is just one idea! Alternatively, you might choose to explore:
Your Ikigai
Your ideal learning environment
Your SWOT
Opportunities to give back to your community
...Or any other aspect of the course!
What's important is to choose something that you could benefit from re-organizing into a personally meaningful a way.

The 4 P's for mindmapping:
I suggest that you split this activity into five steps, which I'll call "The 4 Ps". 

Plan.
Prepare.
Paper or Specialised computer program or Graphics editor.
Practise.
Perfect it.

Step 5
Constantly assess yourself
For some people, this is a real worry; for others, it's an opportunity to receive feedback. In all cases, it is a moment of truth. 
As a super-learner, you should welcome this stage with open arms to maximise your progress.

I suggest that you distinguish two types of assessment:

Formal assessments, carried out by third parties who are as objective and impartial as possible.

Informal assessments, which are indeed more subjective since they are carried out by people you know, or even by yourself. 
These assessments are much easier to set up, but they are, certainly, a bit less reliable. 
As you shall see, in spite of that, they are far from being useless.

Assess yourself
One thing that separates the good learners from the excellent ones is their ability to self-assess and set corrective actions.
Remember this well: Assessment is a sort of hygiene regime for learning.

Have yourself assessed by a third party
Once you have completed a training process and conducted a self-assessment, it is helpful to ask someone else to evaluate you.
